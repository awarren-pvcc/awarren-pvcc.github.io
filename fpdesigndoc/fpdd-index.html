        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My project is a text-based adventure. I am using an algorithm that pulls and displays locations, descriptions of them, and predetermined user choices to the player depending on the location they are currently at. Once they choose an option from the list of choices, theory location is updated based on that and the cycle repeats based on the new location.
        </p>
        <p>If the user’s choice matches one of the available choices, their location is updated and the new location’s description is printed. If their choice does not match an available choice, a ”can’t do that here” error is displayed and the description and options are repeated.
        </p>
        <p>I’m using a dictionary to store my location data and the options that are available for each location. It also stores which options lead to which new locations.
