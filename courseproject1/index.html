        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Protecting material for exclusive use under copyright can be good for a market. It prevents fraud, ensures consumers know what they’re buying, and provides a need to develop new ideas within the market itself. However, it’s not always good for every market. Precisely, infrastructure in the world of electronic communications can often be held back by this practice more than benefited by it. Withholding the use of infrastructure often riddles the digital world we have today with incompatibility, e-waste, and limited choice for consumers.
        </p>
        <h2>The Effects</h2>
        <p>It’s a common complaint from users of Apple, Google, and Microsoft products that they’re “Stuck in the ecosystem” of those particular brands. Typically, this is in reference to these companies withholding certain features that their customers have come to rely on. This can remove choice from the hands of buyers, and secure “customers for life” to the corporations at the top.
        </p>
        <p>On paper, it would seem that this promotes competition and a healthy market in this space. However, considering that there are only two major operating systems for both mobile phones and personal computers, it’s clear that it doesn’t. The tech giants that got in the market decades ago are still the ones at the top, leaving nothing but scraps for newcomers. On top of that, these operating systems almost never interact with one another, with the most egregious player being Apple.
        </p>
        <p>Not long ago, in fact, Apple was in a long legal battle with the European Union against their incessant use of their own proprietary Lightning cables. While Apple’s sole use of their own design is a discussion of its own, their intense protection of the port against use by third parties is a clear example of the setbacks left by these patents, with the incompatibility and e-waste from Apple’s decisions still being felt today. Had Apple allowed the use of its product by other companies, it’s possible that they could even be reaping the benefits of Lightning being the main cable used today, considering it was invented nearly two whole years before USB-C, the near universal charging cable in 2024.
        </p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>This is unfortunately the way these companies are incentivised to operate. If one of them were to simply choose to release all of their source code or give up their patents, it wouldn’t fix the problem at hand. It’s possible that scenario would lead to better compatibility between different proprietary infrastructures, but it would almost definitely be at the cost of making the other companies even stronger, and thus eliminating even more choice from consumers.
        </p>
        <p>It might be easy to see the solution as simply not allowing tech companies to protect their infrastructure and features at all, but this creates even more problems than it solves. With no way to incentivise users to pick their product over others, there would be little reason for these companies to compete with each other at all.
        </p>
        <p>	The solution here is to find a balance of what’s acceptable for companies to own that can provide a compelling reason to use their product, but without stifling innovation. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is one of the founding pieces of technology that makes the internet possible, and it’s public for everyone to use. If it was patented by its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, the world wide web might only be available to use for companies that could afford whatever licensing fees it would come with, directly blocking technological advancement and communication as we know today- while also defeating the entire purpose of the web itself.
        </p>
        <p>	Infrastructure that opens new possibilities to humanity like HTTP shouldn’t even be possible to patent and we’re lucky that it was donated to the public. Patentable technologies, though, such as Apple’s Airplay or Microsoft’s MS-RPC should be either licensable, or have a shortened patent and copyright lengths. Alternatively, they should be patentable but not copyrightable. These solutions accomplish the same thing: Allowing companies to make money off of their idea for a shorter amount of time before having to release them to public domain. This would both encourage these top companies to innovate more while also making it easier for new, smaller companies to compete with them. Thus, the tech space would become a flourishing market even more full of innovation and change than it is today.
        </p>
        <p>		Some of the key organizations which have power to influence these propositions are WIPO (The World Intellectual Property Organization), The US Chamber of Commerce, and The World Economic Forum. While the latter agrees that copyright laws must change in order to stimulate a healthy, innovative future, the other two seem to be more interested in keeping the top companies at the top. Unfortunately, these are the two that have the most power in this area. Their minds will need to be changed if we want to see ourselves into the technological future we deserve.
